# horiseon-accessibility-refactor

## Description 

This project's main features are to provide standard accessibility to a website and to practice refactoring HTML and CSS.  The primary motivation is to replace ambiguous HTML with semantic tags so that user's with screen readers can more efficiently access the webpage. Horiseon's provided starter code functioned almost exclusively with DIV elements and lacked alternate text, which meant that screen readers were not able to identify navigational pages or describe visuals to users. The refactoring of this site's HTML provides access to those who browse via screen readers and other accessibility tools.

I learned the value of testing code changes in atomic level (smallest piece of code) to preserve functionality and discover how code interacts. 
- In-page links to HTML ID attributes can help users scroll to specific points on the page
- HTML NAV elements and HTML ALT attributes are used by screen readers for user accessibility
- (Note: This project follows a week of instruction on the fundamentals of these languages and tests the limits of what is possible with code.)
