        (1) add the image to HTML manually or
        (2) revise the file path in the CSS file from ../images/digital-marketing-meeting.jpg to ./images/digital-marketing-meeting.jpg with one less dot, thus one less upward folder or
        (3) place the .jpg file in the correct location (one folder up)

            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your visibility and find the right customers for your business.

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

            <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing helps you determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and increase your lead generation.

                Inbound strategies for lead generation require less work for your business, bringing customers directly to your website.
